  Master controller for the lit-review pipeline, driven by a document. Give it a
  .tex or .docx file describing an article — a full manuscript, an abstract, or a
  proposal — and it extracts a search plan, runs Undermind (an automated
  Playwright driver in Classic mode) and Google Scholar (SearchAPI.io), then
  merges, deduplicates, and screens the results. Only use this skill when
  explicitly requested — e.g., the user says "run lit-review-orchestrator",

# Lit-Review Orchestrator

Run the literature-review pipeline from a single command, starting from a
document that describes your article.

**Input**: a `.tex` or `.docx` document — a full manuscript, an abstract, or any
text describing the article's content.
**Output**: a deduplicated, relevance-screened master list (JSON + RIS), plus the
extracted search plan and all intermediate stage files.

## Quick Start

The `orchestrator.py` commands below are the **autonomous fallback** (reasoning on
the Sonnet/DeepSeek API). When Claude runs this skill it uses the **agent-driven
flow** instead — see *How it runs* below — which runs every non-browser reasoning
step at the agent layer with no API key, splitting the work between Opus 4.8 and
Sonnet 4.6 subagents (see *Model routing*).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt                                  # one-time
cp lit-review-pipeline.env.example ~/.lit-review-pipeline.env    # then fill in keys

# From a full manuscript
python scripts/orchestrator.py paper.docx --output-dir ~/lit-reviews/mypaper

# From just an abstract (any .tex/.docx describing the article works)
python scripts/orchestrator.py abstract.tex --output-dir ~/lit-reviews/mypaper

# Add opt-in sources; DOI-only dedup
python scripts/orchestrator.py paper.tex --ssrn --nber --no-llm --output-dir out

# Escape hatch: run from a raw query string (skips Stage 0 extraction)
python scripts/orchestrator.py --query "dual-class shares cost of equity" --output-dir out
```

## Pipeline

| Stage | Name | Default | What it does |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| 0 | Extract | on | Parse the document; Claude derives the research question, an Undermind brief, a Scholar Labs question, and Google Scholar queries |
| 1 | Undermind | on | Automated Undermind.ai Classic deep search from the brief (Playwright; signs in with stored credentials) |
| 2 | Scholar Labs | opt-in | Google Scholar Labs deep search via `--scholarlabs` (Playwright; stored Google login). Off by default — Google rate-limits its Cite/BibTeX export under automation, so it often defers |
| 2b | Deep Research | on | Gemini Deep Research Agent (Interactions API; `GEMINI_API_KEY`) — alternative API-driven deep search |
| 4a | Google Scholar | on | SearchAPI.io Google Scholar, driven by the extracted queries |
| 4b | Supplementary | off | SSRN / NBER / HeinOnline / forthcoming (`--ssrn --nber --heinonline --forthcoming`) |
| 4c | Citation chain | off | Semantic Scholar (`--citation-chain`; needs DOI-bearing seeds) |
| 5 | Dedup | on | Merge all outputs; metadata enrichment + DOI and LLM fuzzy dedup |
| 5b | Verify | on | Cross-check every paper against OpenAlex / Crossref / Semantic Scholar and **drop** any none can confirm (anti-hallucination); if an index outage leaves >30% of papers uncheckable, it keeps everything and warns instead of dropping. `--no-verify` keeps all; dropped papers saved to `stage5_merged_unverified.json` |
| 6 | Screen | on | Abstract relevance screening against the research question |

Stage 0 runs first; Stages 1, 2b, and 4a run concurrently (Stage 2 Scholar Labs joins them only with `--scholarlabs`, and 4b when opted in); 4c follows them; then 5, then 6.

## How it runs: agent-driven (default) vs autonomous fallback

LLM work follows one routing rule: **the agent-driven flow uses no Anthropic API
at all.** Every LLM step — Stage 0 extraction, Stage 4 query condensation, Stage 5
dedup judgments, Stage 6 screening, the keyless web search, and even Undermind's
clarifying answers — runs at the agent layer (you, the orchestrator, plus the Opus
and Sonnet subagents you spawn through the Task/Agent tool, none of which consume an
Anthropic API key). Which model each step uses is set by *Model routing* below.
Undermind is a subprocess that owns the live browser, so its clarifying questions
come back to the agent through a small file handshake (`--answers-dir`): the driver
writes each question to a file and types whatever answer you drop back. The
Sonnet/DeepSeek API path survives only as the **autonomous fallback**
(`orchestrator.py`), for unattended runs with no agent present.

Because a Python subprocess cannot spawn subagents, each reasoning script exposes
an **emit/ingest seam**: the script does the deterministic work (parsing,
candidate-pair generation, validation, enrichment, merge, all file output) and
hands only the LLM step out to you in the middle. Each script also keeps its
in-script Sonnet/DeepSeek API path as an **autonomous fallback** for unattended
runs, so nothing is lost when no agent is present.

### Model routing (agent-driven flow)

Reasoning is split across two keyless models, both dispatched through the Claude
Code Task/Agent tool (no Anthropic API key, no search account):

| Role / stage | Model | How it is dispatched |
|--------------|-------|----------------------|
| Orchestrator — coordinate the run, parse the GUI config, fan out, merge | **Opus 4.8** | the main session (this conversation) |
| Stage 0 — extract the search plan | **Opus 4.8** | the orchestrator itself, or an Opus subagent |
| Keyless web search — Stage 4d subagent fan-out | **Opus 4.8** | one Opus subagent per batch |
| Re-ranker — Stage 6 relevance screening | **Opus 4.8** | parallel Opus subagents |
| Everything else — Stage 4a query writing / condensation, Stage 5 dedup judgments, Undermind clarifying answers | **Sonnet 4.6** (default) | one Sonnet subagent per task (spawn with `model: "sonnet"`) |

Sonnet is the default for the "everything else" group because those steps are
high-volume, comparatively low-stakes judgments; Opus is reserved for the
orchestration, the search-plan extraction, the open-web search, and the final
relevance ranking. Both models run keyless, so the zero-API-key property holds
either way.

**Override — use Opus everywhere.** When the GUI's *Use Opus for all tasks* box is
checked, the config carries `"all_opus": true`; dispatch **every** subagent on Opus
4.8, so the Sonnet defaults above are promoted to Opus and the run reproduces the
original all-Opus behavior. The keyless property is unchanged. When `all_opus` is
false or absent, follow the split in the table.

### Interactive entry (GUI)

When the skill is triggered interactively, open the settings dialog first, let the
user choose the input and options, then run the agent-driven stages below honouring
what it returns:
```bash
python scripts/lit_review_gui.py --config-out OUT/gui_config.json   # blocks until Run/Cancel
```
The window has a **Browse** field for the document (or a raw-query box), an output
folder, the **search channels** as checkboxes — keyed (Undermind / Deep Research /
Google Scholar checked; Scholar Labs unchecked — opt-in) and keyless (Free index
search / Web search, both on) — **supplementary sources**
(SSRN checked by default, NBER, HeinOnline) plus citation chaining, **Processing**
(Deduplicate / Verify sources / Screen / DOI-only), and an **Advanced** group (Quick
mode, Max chars, and a *Use Opus for all tasks* toggle that is off by default —
leave it off to run the default Opus/Sonnet split from *Model routing*, check it to
put every subagent on Opus). On
**Run** it writes the settings to `--config-out` *and* echoes them to stdout
between `===LITREVIEW_CONFIG_BEGIN===` and `===LITREVIEW_CONFIG_END===` (exit 0);
**Cancel** or closing the window exits 2 — abort the run. Parse that JSON and map it
onto the stages: skip a channel set `false`, set `output_dir`, run Scholar Labs /
supplementary / citation and the keyless `freesearch` (Stage 4e) / `websearch`
(Stage 4d) channels when `true`, pass `--no-verify` to dedup when `verify` is
false and `--no-llm` when `no_llm` is true, skip dedup/screen when false, pass
`max_chars` to extraction, and — when `all_opus` is true — dispatch every subagent
on Opus instead of the default Sonnet split (see *Model routing*). The GUI runs
nothing itself and calls no API. Shape:
```json
{"document":"…","query":"","output_dir":"…",
 "channels":{"undermind":true,"deepresearch":true,"scholar":true,"scholarlabs":false,"freesearch":true,"websearch":true},
 "supplementary":{"ssrn":true,"nber":false,"heinonline":false},
 "citation_chain":false,"top_seeds":20,
 "dedup":true,"verify":true,"screen":true,"no_llm":false,"quick":false,"max_chars":30000,"all_opus":false}
```

### Agent-driven run (the default — you orchestrate)

Pick an output dir `OUT`. Run the deterministic stages as subprocesses and do the
reasoning stages on the models set in *Model routing* above — Sonnet subagents by
default, with Opus for the orchestrator, Stage 0 extraction, the keyless web search,
and the re-ranker, or for everything when `all_opus` is set. Substitute `<doc>` and
the extracted `<research_question>`.

**Stage 0 — extract (you, Opus):**
```bash
python scripts/extract_search_plan.py <doc> --emit-prompt OUT/extract_prompt.txt -o OUT/search_plan.json
# Read OUT/extract_prompt.txt, produce the plan JSON on Opus (yourself or an Opus subagent), write OUT/plan.json.
python scripts/extract_search_plan.py <doc> --plan-file OUT/plan.json -o OUT/search_plan.json
```
The plan JSON must carry `extract_search_plan.py`'s `REQUIRED_KEYS`; `--plan-file`
validates them (exit 1 on a bad plan) and writes search_plan.json/.md,
scholar_queries.json, undermind_brief.txt, scholarlabs_query.txt.

**Stages 1 / 2b / 4a — search (subprocesses; run concurrently, background + Monitor). Stage 2 Scholar Labs is opt-in — run it only on request (see below):**
```bash
python undermind-search/scripts/undermind_search.py --brief-file OUT/undermind_brief.txt \
    -o OUT/stage1_undermind.json --debug-dir OUT/debug_undermind --answers-dir OUT/undermind_clarify
# Agent-in-the-loop, no API: while it runs, watch OUT/undermind_clarify for clarify_request_<n>.json.
# When one appears, answer the question with a Sonnet subagent (Opus when all_opus), grounded in the
# brief and the Stage-0 undermind_clarifications, and write OUT/undermind_clarify/clarify_answer_<n>.json = {"answer": "..."}.
# Practical pattern: launch a background job that blocks until the request file exists (so you are
# notified), answer it, then re-arm for the next turn. Undermind is interactive in this mode.
# Opt-in only (Scholar Labs): Google rate-limits its Cite export under automation, so skip it by
# default and run this line only when asked / retrying from a fresh session:
python scholarlabs-search/scripts/scholarlabs_search.py --query-file OUT/scholarlabs_query.txt \
    --research-question "<research_question>" -o OUT/stage2_scholarlabs.json --hidden --debug-dir OUT/debug_scholarlabs
python deepresearch-search/scripts/deepresearch_search.py --query-file OUT/undermind_brief.txt \
    --research-question "<research_question>" -o OUT/stage2b_deepresearch.json --debug-dir OUT/debug_deepresearch  # Gemini Deep Research (GEMINI_API_KEY), pure subprocess
python supplementary-search/scripts/supplementary_search.py --scholar \
    --queries-file OUT/scholar_queries.json -o OUT/stage4a_scholar.json --debug-dir OUT/debug_scholar
```
Passing `--queries-file` (the agent-written queries — a Sonnet subagent by default,
Opus when `all_opus`) bypasses the in-script `condense_query` fallback in
supplementary-search. For a raw-query agent run (no document, hence no Stage 0 to
produce `scholar_queries.json`), first have a Sonnet subagent write that file (a
short JSON array of query strings) and pass it the same way, or add `--no-condense`
— either keeps the agent path free of the in-script API call.

**Web search (keyless; the "only Claude Code" channel, and a useful add-on alongside
the keyed channels). Subagent fan-out, so the raw web text stays out of your
context.** This is the *keyless search* in *Model routing* — it runs on **Opus**
regardless of `all_opus`. Emit a batched task plan, dispatch one Opus subagent per
batch, then merge:
```bash
python websearch-search/scripts/websearch_ingest.py --emit-tasks \
    --queries-file OUT/scholar_queries.json --research-question "<research_question>" \
    --batch-size 3 -o OUT/websearch_tasks.json
# Dispatch one Opus subagent per tasks[k]: hand it the system_prompt + its queries;
# each runs WebSearch/WebFetch over its queries and writes
# OUT/websearch_results_batch_<id>.json (only title required; never invent fields; do
# not fetch scholar.google.com). Then merge the partials:
python websearch-search/scripts/websearch_ingest.py \
    --results OUT/websearch_results_batch_*.json -o OUT/stage4d_websearch.json
```
This writes `stage4d_websearch.json` (`source="websearch"`), deduped by title with
best-effort keyless Crossref DOI fill, which the dedup `--inputs` glob below picks up.
The hits are real web results, so keep Stage 5b verification ON. For a few queries you
can skip the fan-out and ingest a single `websearch_results.json`. Empty input defers
(`WEBSEARCH_DEFERRED`). Full recipe: `websearch-search/SKILL.md`.

**Free index search (keyless; pairs with web search for the no-key fallback).** A
plain keyless subprocess that searches OpenAlex / Crossref / Semantic Scholar with
the Stage-0 queries:
```bash
python freesearch-search/scripts/freesearch_search.py \
    --queries-file OUT/scholar_queries.json -o OUT/stage4e_freesearch.json
```
This writes `stage4e_freesearch.json` (real index records, `source` set per index),
which the dedup `--inputs` glob below also picks up. No key needed; see
`freesearch-search/SKILL.md`.

**Stage 5 — dedup (Sonnet subagents by default; Opus when `all_opus`):**
```bash
python lit-dedup/scripts/lit_dedup.py --inputs OUT/stage[0-9]*.json --emit-pairs OUT/dedup_pairs.json -o OUT/stage5_merged.json
# Read OUT/dedup_pairs.json; for each pairs[k] = {i, j, a, b} decide if a and b are the
# same paper. Fan out across parallel Sonnet subagents (Opus when all_opus) for large pair sets. Write
# OUT/dedup_verdicts.json = [{"i":N,"j":N,"decision":"yes|no","confidence":"high|medium|low","rationale":"..."}].
python lit-dedup/scripts/lit_dedup.py --ingest-verdicts OUT/dedup_pairs.json OUT/dedup_verdicts.json -o OUT/stage5_merged.json
```
Exclude `stage5_*` / `stage6_*` from the `--inputs` glob. If `dedup_pairs.json` has
no pairs, write `[]` to the verdicts file and still run `--ingest-verdicts`.

**Stage 6 — screen (the re-ranker — Opus subagents, regardless of `all_opus`):**
```bash
python lit-screen/scripts/lit_screen.py --input OUT/stage5_merged.json --query "<research_question>" \
    --emit-tasks OUT/screen_tasks.json -o OUT/stage6_screened.json
# Read OUT/screen_tasks.json = {system_prompt, query, tasks:[{index, user_message}]}.
# Score each task following system_prompt. Fan out across parallel Opus subagents in batches. Write
# OUT/screen_results.json = [{"index":N,"relevance_score":1-10,"rationale":"..","paper_type":"..","identification_strategy":"..","relationship":".."}].
python lit-screen/scripts/lit_screen.py --input OUT/stage5_merged.json --ingest-results OUT/screen_results.json -o OUT/stage6_screened.json
```

### Autonomous fallback (no agent)
```bash
python scripts/orchestrator.py <doc> --output-dir OUT
```
Runs every stage end-to-end as subprocesses; the reasoning stages call the
Anthropic API on Sonnet (DeepSeek for dedup). The keyless free index search (Stage
4e) runs here by default (`--no-freesearch` to skip); web search (Stage 4d) is
agent-only and not available in this runner. Use it for unattended runs or when
no agent is driving. It is the fallback, not the default.

### Undermind (Stage 1)

Undermind runs automatically from the extracted brief. The driver
(`undermind-search/scripts/undermind_search.py`) launches Playwright, signs in
with the credentials in `~/.lit-review-pipeline.env`, drives the Classic search
(sidebar **Classic** → **Search** → brief → Claude answers the clarifying
questions → **Generate Research Report**), waits for the report, and exports the
references (BibTeX by default). `undermind_ingest.py` then parses and enriches
them into `stage1_undermind.json` (+ `.bib`). First-time setup stores the
credentials with `python undermind-search/scripts/undermind_search.py --login`.

If credentials are missing or login/export fails, the stage degrades gracefully:
it prints `UNDERMIND_DEFERRED`, writes empty results, and the pipeline continues
on Google Scholar (the brief remains in `undermind_brief.txt`). When the Undermind
UI changes, re-confirm the locators by driving the live site with the windows-mcp
desktop tools, then update them in the driver (see `undermind-search/SKILL.md`).
The previous Playwright automation for older UIs is preserved under `_legacy/`.

### Scholar Labs (Stage 2)

Google Scholar Labs is **opt-in** (pass `--scholarlabs`; off by default because Google
rate-limits its Cite/BibTeX export under automation, so it frequently defers — Undermind
and Deep Research are the dependable deep-search channels). When enabled it runs from the
**Scholar Labs question** Stage 0
writes to `scholarlabs_query.txt` — a single detailed research question, which is
a different input from the Undermind brief. The driver
(`scholarlabs-search/scripts/scholarlabs_search.py`) drives Playwright: it signs
in to Google with a persistent profile (`~/.scholar-profile`), submits the
question, waits for the result cards, and reads each result's citation through the
standard Scholar **Cite → BibTeX** export; `scholarlabs_ingest.py` parses and
enriches them into `stage2_scholarlabs.json` (+ `.bib`). It returns ~10 highly
relevant papers that complement Undermind's broader set. First-time setup seeds
the Google session with
`python scholarlabs-search/scripts/scholarlabs_search.py --login` (sign in by
hand, including any 2FA).

**This stage runs off-screen, not headless.** Google serves headless/automated
Scholar an "unusual traffic" CAPTCHA, but a *real* headed Chrome passes — so the
orchestrator runs it with `--hidden`: a genuine headed window positioned far
off-screen, reusing the seeded session, so the stage works without anything
appearing in front of you. If the session lapses and a 2FA wall appears (which an
off-screen window can't clear), the stage defers with a desktop alert telling you
to re-run `--login` (visible) to re-authorize. A missing sign-in or CAPTCHA also
degrades gracefully (`SCHOLARLABS_DEFERRED`, empty results) and the pipeline
continues. Disable it with `--skip scholarlabs`. See `scholarlabs-search/SKILL.md`.

## Input parsing

`scripts/manuscript_parser.py` is bundled and ships with the skill, so a fresh
clone works with no dependency beyond `python-docx`:

- **`.docx`** — the body is walked in document order so paragraphs and tables are
  captured, and tracked-change text is included (technique adopted from the
  `word-docx` skill's `extract_text`). Footnotes and endnotes are read directly
  from the document XML so they are never lost.
- **`.tex`** — title, abstract, sections, and `\footnote{}` content are extracted;
  the bibliography and `\cite`/`\ref` keys are stripped so they do not pollute the
  topic profile. `\input`/`\include` targets are inlined.

Short inputs such as a bare abstract are handled: the text becomes a single block
and the extractor infers the framing.

## API keys

Stored in `~/.lit-review-pipeline.env` (auto-loaded; template in
`lit-review-pipeline.env.example`). Real environment variables take precedence.

| Variable | Needed for |
|----------|-----------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Autonomous fallback only (`orchestrator.py`): Stage 0, dedup, screening, and Undermind clarifying answers. The agent-driven flow needs no Anthropic key. |
| `SEARCHAPI_API_KEY` | Google Scholar + SSRN/HeinOnline/forthcoming (required for search) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Stage 2b Gemini Deep Research (default-on alternative deep search) |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | LLM fuzzy dedup + Crossref title matching (recommended) |
| `OPENALEX_API_KEY` | OpenAlex Premium for enrichment (optional) |
| `UNDERMIND_EMAIL` / `UNDERMIND_PASSWORD` | Undermind login (Stage 1 driver; set on first run via `--login`) |
| `SCHOLAR_EMAIL` / `SCHOLAR_PASSWORD` | Google login for Scholar Labs (Stage 2 driver; set on first run via `--login`) |

## CLI flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `document` | — | Path to a `.tex`/`.docx` document (positional) |
| `--query` | — | Run from a raw query instead of a document (skips Stage 0) |
| `--output-dir` | `./lit-review-output` | Output directory |
| `--model` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Model for Stage 0 extraction |
| `--screen-model` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Model for Stage 6 screening |
| `--max-chars` | `30000` | Max document characters sent to the extractor |
| `--skip` | none | Skip default stages: `undermind`, `deepresearch`, `scholar`, `dedup`, `screen` |
| `--quick` | off | Fast run: SearchAPI Google Scholar only (skips the Undermind and Deep Research deep-search stages) |
| `--scholarlabs` | off | Opt in to the Google Scholar Labs deep search (Stage 2); off by default because Google rate-limits its Cite export under automation |
| `--ssrn --nber --heinonline --forthcoming` | off | Opt-in supplementary sources |
| `--citation-chain` | off | Opt-in Semantic Scholar citation chaining |
| `--no-llm` | off | DOI-only dedup (skip LLM pass) |
| `--verify / --no-verify` | on | Cross-check papers vs OpenAlex/Crossref/Semantic Scholar and drop those none can confirm (anti-hallucination); `--no-verify` keeps all (dropped papers saved to `stage5_merged_unverified.json`) |
| `--top-seeds` | `20` | Seeds for citation chaining |

## Operational notes

- Run in the foreground; the dashboard streams stage status to the console and `pipeline.log`.
- Stages 5 (dedup) and 6 (screen) can be re-run standalone after editing any stage input file.
- Citation chaining needs DOI-bearing seeds, so it is most useful once Undermind enrichment is active.
- Stage 0 failure aborts the run (the pipeline cannot proceed without a search plan).
- The SSRN, HeinOnline, and forthcoming sources are Google Scholar searches with a
  `site:`/`source:` filter — subsets of Stage 4a — so they mainly force those venues
  to surface rather than adding a new index. NBER (`nber.org` API) and citation
  chaining (Semantic Scholar) hit independent indexes and add genuine coverage.
- `--quick` runs only the SearchAPI Google Scholar channel (no browser, no login),
  useful for a fast pass or when the Undermind/Scholar Labs logins are unavailable.
